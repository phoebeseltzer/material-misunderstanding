<!-- Fragments -->
<section>
  <p>It began as imitation. Ivory, tortoiseshell, coral. The first plastics weren’t meant to replace nature — just to relieve it. Fewer elephants. Same combs.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>Then came war. Nylon for parachutes, polyethylene for radar, Bakelite in weapons. The same materials that mimicked elegance were turned toward survival.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>Plastic doesn’t decay. It fragments. Not into soil, but into data: microplastic, nanoparticle, traceable but unresolved. A slow unmaking without return.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>We now engineer enzymes to degrade it. Worms and fungi, trained to digest what we built to last. Nature, hired to erase our imitation of nature.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>Polymer chains hold their shape. Systems do too. Once built, they tend to repeat — regardless of what they were made for.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>Plastic was sold as freedom. Now it lines the blood, the soil, the milk. Ubiquity is not invisibility — only fatigue.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>It still works. That’s the problem.</p>
</section>
