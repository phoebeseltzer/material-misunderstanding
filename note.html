  <h1>Note from Inside the System</h1>

  <p>I spend my days funding technologies that try to fix the future by editing biology.</p>

  <p>We change the DNA of yeast to make silk, algae to grow cement, and bacteria to synthesize consumer products. Right now, as I write this, I’m watching a webinar where someone’s editing <em>E. coli</em> to manufacture cobalt for B12 — even though <em>E. coli</em> has no natural relationship to cobalt or B12.</p>

  <p>It’s brilliant. It’s necessary. It’s a little ridiculous.</p>

  <p><strong>Welcome to the loop.</strong></p>

  <p>We’re solving problems created by earlier solutions.  
  Plastic was invented to save the elephants. Now we engineer enzymes to digest the plastic.  
  Nature was copied to spare it. Now we study nature to undo the copy.</p>

  <p>This is not satire. This is innovation.</p>

  <p>Every week, I hear a new pitch:</p>
  <blockquote>
    “We’re using synthetic biology to fix agriculture.”<br>
    “We’ve reprogrammed microbes to upcycle carbon.”<br>
    “We mimic photosynthesis with 12% higher efficiency.”
  </blockquote>


  <p>It’s not that these projects are wrong, in fact many are necessary and revolutionary. But there's a strange, recursive elegance to it all. We keep trying to fix what we broke by mimicking what we broke it with. We simulate systems we don’t fully understand, then invest in their remediation — with new simulations. Biology becomes interface. Repair becomes product.</p>

  <p>This isn’t a condemnation. It's a confession.</p>

  <p>I believe in these technologies. But I also believe we’re inside a  (economic, ecological, epistemic) feedback loop and no amount of CRISPR, machine learning, or biomimicry will save us from the consequences of not understanding the system we’re modifying.</p>

  <p>So this project — <em>The System Tried to Understand Itself</em> — is partly a mirror. Partly a memoir. Partly an exercise in systems-level humility.</p>

  <p>It doesn’t reject synthetic biology. It just asks:  
      <blockquote>
     Do we know the system well enough to edit it?<br>
    Do we remember the relationships before we replicate the function?<br>
    Are we solving the problem, or simulating a fix inside the same myopic frame?
  </blockquote>
 

  <p><strong>I fund the recursion.  
  This is my record of it.</strong></p>
