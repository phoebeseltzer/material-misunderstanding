  <section class="fade">This is a gallery of materials that became systems. And of systems that no longer know how to stop.</section>

  <section class="fade">Each entry in this archive traces a contradiction — where a material’s intended purpose diverged from its cultural effect. Plastic was invented to save nature. Now it pollutes every ecosystem on Earth. Silicon began as sand. It became the metaphor for thought. Salt sparked revolutions. Now it hides in processed food and road slush. Lead was used to sweeten wine, then water, then paint — before we finally remembered what it does to the brain.</section>

  <section class="fade">This archive does not offer a solution. It’s not a warning. It’s a record of how modern systems learned to use matter without memory. A way of asking: What do we know, when we’re no longer embedded in what we’re using? What remains, when the purpose of a material outlives the system it served?</section>
